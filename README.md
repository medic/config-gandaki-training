# CHT Product Template Repository

This is a template repository for CHT Products. You can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files as in this repository.

## Create a repository from this template

When [creating a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) under the Medic organization, select `cht-repo-template` as a template to use for the new repository.

You can also create a repository directly from the template by following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

_Note_: You can read more about CHT Product repositories [in the CHT documentation](https://docs.communityhealthtoolkit.org/contribute/code/repository-checklist).
